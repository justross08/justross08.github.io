While now I only am a recreational runner, I'm very proud of my past accomplishments in competitive running. It was very important in shaping who I am today. Most of all, it taught me discipline, dedication, and leadership which have stayed with me now several years since my last competitive race. I am always interested in new running partners. Here are my favorite highlights from my racing career in both cross-country and track:
